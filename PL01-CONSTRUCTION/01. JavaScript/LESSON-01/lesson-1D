Variable, LET, CONST (W3SCHOOLS)

# javascript variables 
-> 4 ways to declare a javascript variable 
    - using (var) 
    - using (let)
    - using (const)
    - using nothing 
-> variables are containers for storing data (storing data values) 
-- without (var | let | const) keyword any (single letter or word) not string can be 
   defined as a variable any value assigned to it, and is a (undeclared) variable 
-- but without declaration keyword or assigning value any (letter or word) if is not 
   a string will stop execution for error 
-> when to use javascript (var) 
-- always declare javascript variables with (var | let | const) keyword
-- the (var) keyword is used in all javascript code from 1995 to 2015
-- the (let and const) keywords are added to javascript in 2015
-- NB: if you want your code to run in older browser, you must use (var) 
-> when to use javascript (const) 
-- if you want a general rule: always declare variables with (const) 
-- if you think the value of the variable can change, ust (let) 
-> javascript identifiers 
-- all javascript variables must be identified with unique names 
-- these unique names are called identifiers 
-- identifiers can be short names or more descriptive names 
-- the general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are - 
    - names can contain (letters | digits | underscores | dollar signs) 
    - names must begin with a letter 
    - names can also begin with ($ and _)
    - names are case-sensitive 
    - reserved words (keywords) cannot be used as names 
-> the assignment operator 
-- the equal sign (=) is an assignment operator, not an equal-to operator
-- the equal-to operator is written like (==) in javascript 
-> javascript data-types 
-- javascript variables can hold numbers and text values 
-- in programming, text values are called text string \
-- js can handle may types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings 
-- strings are written inside double or single quotes, 
-- numbers are written without quotes 
-- if you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string

Starting with JavaScript (MDN)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> javascript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website 
-> this happens in a games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or 
   with data entry on forms, with dynamic styling, with animation, etc 

# what is javascript
-> JS is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website
-> it was intented by Brendan Eich 
-> javascript is versatile and beginner-friendly
-> with more experience, you'll be able to create game, animated 2D and 3D graphics, 
-- comprehensive (database-driven) apps, and much more 
-> javascript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible
-> developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core js language, 
-- unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. these include - 
    -> browser application programming interface (APIs) built into web browsers, 
      - providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS,
      - collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, 
      - or generating 3D graphics 
      - and audio samples 
    -> third-party (APIs) that allow developers to incorporate functionality in 
    -- in sites from other content providers, such as twitter or facebook 
    -> third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate 
    -- the work of building sites and applications 
-> NB: the core javascript language is different from the tools listed above 
-- there are some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to play 
   with a few browser API features too -

   -- data types 
   -- comments 
   -- operators 
   -- conditionals 
   -- functions 
   -- events

   -- adding an image changer 
   -- adding a personalized welcome message 
   -- a user name of null
